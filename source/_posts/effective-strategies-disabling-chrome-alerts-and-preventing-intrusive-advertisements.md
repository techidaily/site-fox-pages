##  1- Stop Notifications Request in Google Chrome

When you open a new site in your Chrome browser, the website asks your permission to show notifications. You can either select Allow or Block.

You will know in this section how to stop this request permanently from all websites. No website could ask you to show notifications.

Let the extension install and it will start working just after the installation.

I tested this extension on five different websites with different overlay types:

* Navigate away from the page

Out of all the sites, Poper Blocker was able to block the pop-ups on about four of them.

There isn’t a perfect solution to get rid of all the overlays and pop-ups. However, Poper Blocker would certainly help you a lot to prevent most of them and provide you a smooth browsing experience.

## 5- Unroll Paginated Articles on Chrome

Imagine reading the “Top 50 Food Joints in China” article where you have click for about 50 times to learn about all the food joints. Now imagine reading the same details mentioned in a single page without requiring to click numerous times.

To unroll these paginated articles, install the Evernote extension available on Google Chrome Web Store. To install the extension, follow these simple steps:
