##  1- Stop Notifications Request in Google Chrome

When you open a new site in your Chrome browser, the website asks your permission to show notifications. You can either select Allow or Block. This request appears beside the address field where the lock icon appears. You can close this request by pressing the cross button but next time you open that website, it will again appear. You will know in this section how to stop this request permanently from all websites. No website could ask you to show notifications.

If you press allow then the website start sending push notifications on your computer. The legitimate websites send limited notifications, however, some rogue pages bombard your desktop with lots of push notifications. These notifications appear as pop-ups, you can **[remove pop-ups ads](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)** from chrome.

Let the extension install and it will start working just after the installation.

I tested this extension on five different websites with different overlay types:

* Navigate away from the page
* Pop up in the corner
* Appear when the page loads up

Out of all the sites, Poper Blocker was able to block the pop-ups on about four of them.

There isn’t a perfect solution to get rid of all the overlays and pop-ups. However, Poper Blocker would certainly help you a lot to prevent most of them and provide you a smooth browsing experience.

One day you are listening to your favorite music with full volume on laptop speaker. The other day you are trying to focus on your work and visit a business website with an auto-playing video. The laptop is still at full volume. Wouldn’t it just catch you by surprise?
