## What is a Phishing Attack?

Phishing is an online scam where cybercriminals lure you into providing sensitive information. Otherwise, they try to extract money from you using fake messages. The term is analogous to “fishing” since cybercriminals use baits to trick you into revealing your details.

Most phishing attempts try to get your email address, credit card numbers, mother’s maiden name, phone number, account passwords, etc. They use it to cause financial damage, identity theft, logging into personal accounts, blackmail, or stealing money. 

Still, in the end, it’s you who provide the information to these cybercriminals. Therefore, you can easily save yourself by being cautious.

## Why are Scammers Trying to Steal Your Apple ID?

Well, it is not rocket science. Your Apple ID is a one-stop solution to access all your Apple-related tools. Besides, cybercriminals can access your personal information using your ID.

* Cybercriminals can use your Apple ID to log in to your Apple devices such as Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and much more.
* It also includes your payment and shipping details for purchasing from the App Store.
* Your Apple ID is useful in accessing your security settings, subscription, and in-app purchases.
* Cybercriminals can use your ID to access your iCloud account to download personal images and documents. They can use it to blackmail or defame you.

## Various Methods of Attempting the Apple ID Phishing Scam

There are many ways to execute an Apple ID phishing attempt. Let us see some examples to get an idea about them. Understand the method to prepare yourself from such endeavors.

### **Apple ID Receipt Order Email**

Many phishing scams use fake emails to trick users. You can find something like “Receipt ID,” “Receipt Order,” or “Payment Statement” in the subject line of such emails.

Such emails try to trick you into believing that a transaction is made using your credit card on the Apple account. People usually hurry to cancel the subscription, thinking it might cost them unnecessary money. However, the email lands you on a fake website where it asks you to fill your login details. It might also ask you to verify your credit card number. 

We have provided one such example below:

![Apple phishing receipt email](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-phishing-credentials.png)

You can notice that the sender and email recipient have a suspicious address. They are certainly not from Apple. Besides, the attached receipt is an editable word file. None of the renowned company send a receipt in this format. 

The above example was easy to recognize as a fake email. However, cybercriminals can also make the email look genuine. Look at the below example to get an idea.

### **Apple ID Phone Call Scams**

With evolving technology, it is not challenging to spoof a phone number. Scammers use phone numbers that look genuine to attempt a scam phishing call. It is not straightforward to distinguish between the fake and real numbers. The spoofed call shows a legitimate website, Apple’s logo, and original consumer support number. Thus, you might get tricked into believing it as real.

### **Apple ID Fake Text Message**

Another way of scamming people using a phone number is to send an intriguing text message. It might have text similar to “Your Apple account is blocked.” It then asks you to visit the provided link to unblock your account.

Scammers use such messages to lure you into filling a form. You might enter all your details, which can be used against you, thinking it a legitimate website.

### **Temporarily disabled Apple ID Email**

Similar to the fake message we mentioned earlier, you can also get the same message’s email version.

Such an email would notify you that there was some suspicious activity related to your account. Therefore, Apple’s support team has temporarily disabled your account. Then, it urges you to visit a website that resembles the real one. There, scammers would try to steal your information to execute the phishing attack.

## How to Spot Apple ID Phishing Scams

Some phishing scams might be more challenging to recognize. However, you can always look for suspicious signs since most of them have similar content. 

According to a [study](https://josephsteinberg.com/why-scammers-make-spelling-and-grammar-mistakes/), scammers intentionally keep grammar mistakes in the message. It filters out those people who would do in-depth research before providing their details. A smart audience would investigate more and waste the scammer’s time.

You can look for the below errors in the phishing message to distinguish it from the real one:

* Grammar and spelling mistakes
