## What is Browser\_broker.exe?

Browser\_broker.exe, and the process associated with it, belongs to [Microsoft Windows Operating System](https://www.file.net/process/browser%5Fbroker.exe.html). It normally activates when Microsoft Edge is running. Browser\_broker.exe is located in the C:\\Windows\\System32 folder. It is normally not visible to users unless they check the Task Manager. Also, it rarely eats up significant amount of resources. It should be noted that Browser\_broker.exe is only known to run along with Microsoft Edge. It is rare to have any alerts concerning this piece of a program. Moreover, Microsoft Firewall rarely raises any red flags about Browser\_broker.exe as it works alongside the operating system’s native browser. However, there are several instances when Browser\_broker.exe affects user experience.

## Dangers of Browser\_broker.exe

 Browser\_broker.exe itself is not a harmful file.  In fact, it is an essential system file which is necessary for Microsoft Edge to function. Even so, there will be problems which are associated with this executable file. Legitimate issues with the operating system such as corrupt Windows registry keys may affect Browser\_broker.exe. It may be caused by faulty installation of the operating system or issues during updates and upgrades. Additionally, another program may mistakenly delete Browser\_broker.exe. Any of these circumstances will result in error prompts or even issues with Microsoft Edge.

A notable case is when a malware intentionally deletes or corrupts Browser\_broker.exe. The goal of the malware is to copy or mimic the behavior of the executable file. It will try to fool the user and possibly the security program by pretending to be a system file. Malware that behaves like this are quite difficult to detect without the help of security programs.

## How to Check if Browser\_broker.exe is A Threat

A careful observation of your system would typically reveal strange behavior if a malware is currenty infecting it. As mentioned above, Browser\_broker.exe barely takes resources. A sudden spike in its use of memory and other computing resources should raise a red flag. Also, Browser\_broker.exe should be located in the **C:**\\Windows\\System32 folder where all system files should be saved. If it is located other than the systems32 folder, there’s a chance that it is a form of malware. To check Browser\_broker.exe’s location, do the following: Open **Microsoft Edge**, as it is typically the program that launches the said executable file. Launch the **Task Manager** by right-clicking on your taskbar. Choose **Task Manager**.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Right-click-taskbar.png)Under **Processes** tab, look for **Browser\_broker**. It is typically found under Microsoft Edge process. Click the arrow on the left-side of Microsoft Edge. It should reveal the processes it uses including Browser\_broker.exe. Otherwise, look for Browser\_broker in the list of processes.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Processes.png)Right-click on **Browser\_broker**. Choose **Open file location**. It will open the location of the program file. And, it should open the **system32** folder. If not, you will need to scan your system of any infection by following the steps in the latter part of this article.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/File-Location.png)

### General Computer Cleanup

Uninstall any programs that you no longer need. This is especially important if you are using a laptop which comes with a few bloatware. The rule of thumb is if you haven’t used an application within the last 6 months, then it might be a good idea to remove it. Moreover, check what apps are running during startup. Open the Task Manager as you did above. Go to the **Startup** tab. Examine which apps are needed on startup. To disable a program, right-click on it. Then click **Disable** from the drop-down menu.![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Startup-1.png)For more information about maintaining a clean and fast computer, follow the steps in [this article](https://www.windowschimp.com/speedup-windows-10/).

### Regular Update

No operating system is created perfect. That is why it is important to install updates and patches. You do not have to worry about this as Windows 10 automatically downloads and installs automatic updates. It is important to follow the update instructions if there are any. Additionally, you may want to let your operating system finish its update before doing anything else on the computer. This avoids any incomplete or broken updates which may affect system files such as Browser\_broker.exe.
