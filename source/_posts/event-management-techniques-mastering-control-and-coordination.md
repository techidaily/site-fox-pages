<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Browse selected tree item - SelectionBrowse

This event is used by a SelectionTree control (like the one on "CustomizeDlg") to spawn a Browse dialog, making it possible to modify the highlighted item's path. Any controls that publish a SelectionBrowse event become disabled if the selected feature is already installed, not configurable or not selected for local installation.

### Restart processes using your installation files - RmShutdownAndRestart

This event notifies Windows Installer to use the Restart Manager to shutdown all applications that have files in use and to restart them at the end of the installation. It has **no effect if**:

* the operating system running the installation is not Windows Vista or above
* interactions with the Restart Manager have been disabled by the "MSIRESTARTMANAGERCONTROL" property or the "DisableAutomaticApplicationShutdown" policy
* currently there isn't an open Restart Manager session
* any call from Windows Installer to the Restart Manager returns a failure

### Create new directory in a DirectoryList control - DirectoryListNew

This event notifies a DirectoryList control (like the one in "BrowseDlg") that a new folder must be created. It creates the new folder and selects the folder's name field for editing (the default name is "New Folder"). This event does not use an argument.

![Note](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/svg/common/IconMessageNote.svg)If this control event is called again when a new folder already exists, a second new folder will not be created. In this case, calling DirectoryListNew selects the existing new folder's name for editing.

### Open a directory in a DirectoryList control - DirectoryListOpen

This event selects and highlights a directory in the DirectoryList control (like the one in "BrowseDlg") that the user has chosen to open. This event does not use an argument.

![Note](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/svg/common/IconMessageNote.svg)If no directory has been selected in the DirectoryList control, a DirectoryListOpen event disables any other controls that publish a similar event.

### Open parent directory in a DirectoryList control - DirectoryListUp

This event notifies the DirectoryList control (like the one in "BrowseDlg") that the user wants to select the present directory's parent. This event does not use an argument.

![Note](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/svg/common/IconMessageNote.svg)If the current directory is the drive's root directory, a DirectoryListUp event disables any other controls that publish a similar event.

### Validate ProductID property - ValidateProductID

This event sets the _ProductID_ property to the full Product ID. If the validation is unsuccessful, this event shows an error message and a modal dialog which allows the user to set the Product ID.

### Refresh the current dialog

This event refreshes all user interface controls from the current dialog. 

## Subscribed Events

This type of events are used by controls to subscribe to installer actions (the control is dependent on the action to which it subscribes).

![Important](https://cdn.advancedinstaller.com/svg/common/IconMessageInfo.svg)All the control events described under [Published Events](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) section can be used as a Subscribed Event.

In addition to the control events presented above, a control can subscribe to the following actions:

### Display action data during install - ActionData

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Display installation summary (Enhanced UI only)

This event is used to display overall installation's actions. An multiline edit or text control on a modeless dialog subscribes to this event using the Text attribute to display the installation summary. This event requires the [Enhanced User Interface](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/).

### Display installation details (Enhanced UI only)

This event is used to display detailed actions performed during installation (like which files and registry are installed). An multiline edit or text control on a modeless dialog subscribes to this event using the Text attribute to display the installation summary. This event requires the [Enhanced User Interface](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/). 

### Display action for the selected tree item - SelectionAction

This event is used to publish a string describing the highlighted item in a SelectionTree control (like the one in "CustomizeDlg"). It can affect only the controls located on the same dialog box as the SelectionTree control. A Static Text control which subscribes to it can show the string to the user.

### Display description for the selected tree item - SelectionDescription

This event is used to publish a string which represents the feature's description in a SelectionTree control (like the one in "CustomizeDlg"). It can affect only the controls located on the same dialog box as the SelectionTree control. The description text is the one set in the [Feature Properties](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) page.
