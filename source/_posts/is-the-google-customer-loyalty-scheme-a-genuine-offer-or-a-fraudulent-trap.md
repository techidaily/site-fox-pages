## What is Google Customer Reward Program: Separating Fact from Fiction

Picture this: you’re casually surfing the internet when suddenly, a pop-up message declares you the “Lucky Visitor of the Day” with a chance to bag a lucrative prize. Seems too good to be true, doesn’t it? That’s because it is. This is the notorious “Google Customer Reward Program”, and let’s set the record straight; it’s a hoax. 

## What is the Google Customer Reward Program really?

The deceptive pop-up is a fake message which dangles an enticing bait before the user, usually in the form of a high-end smartphone or a significant gift card. But there lies a snag – to claim your “prize”, you’re required to either complete a survey or pay a nominal shipping fee. Both these paths lead you on a wild-goose chase, costing you privacy, time, and in some regrettable instances, money. The most disappointing part? You end up with nothing at the end of this ordeal.

It is a pop-up scam like [Google Security warning](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or[Your Phone maybe in Danger](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) which works on scaring you whereas this one lures you into a trap.

## Why Do I see Google Membership Rewards Pop-Up?

If this message has become a recurrent sight, you might be left wondering, “Why does the Google Customer (or membership) Reward Program keep appearing?” The culprits behind these scams run ads to trap unsuspecting internet users. 

However, if the pop-up is a regular intruder, it might not be as harmless as an obtrusive ad. It could be a sign that your computer is infected with adware or a browser hijacker. These maleficent programs are engineered to redirect you to harmful websites, coerce you into installing a rogue app, or bamboozle you into paying for a scam.

### Hidden Motive: Data Mining and Privacy Invasions

These pop-ups are not just a nuisance, they’re downright invasive. They are designed to harvest your web browsing data, tracking everything from your IP address to the websites you frequent, the pages you peruse, and even the search queries you make. This data collection is not just a breach of your privacy; it can also lay the groundwork for serious issues like identity theft.

## Google Customer Reward Malware Removal Guide

Manually removing threats may be a time-consuming and difficult task that needs expert-level computer knowledge. So, we recommend professional antivirus program like TotalAV which can detect and remove all traces of virus infection. It can finish the task for you in just one click.

### Don’t Engage

Our primary advice – exit that page immediately. Do not engage with these unexpected pop-ups. Take a moment, clear your browser, and breathe. No credible company, including Google, will offer rewards out of the blue.

### Take Charge of Your Notifications

The next logical step is to [disable notifications from your web browser](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Doing so will give you more control over what pops up on your screen. The good news is that this is fairly straightforward. Simply go to your browser settings, navigate to the ‘Privacy and Security’ section, and look for ‘Site Settings.’ Under ‘Notifications,’ you can block pop-ups and redirects. There you go! You are back in the driver’s seat.

### Uninstall Suspicious / Unwanted Apps

Reflect. Did you recently install new apps or programs? If yes, it’s time to scrutinize them. Thoroughly inspect and uninstall anything that smells fishy. Sometimes, you might come across a potentially unwanted program which came bundled with another program you installed. Remember, it’s always better to be safe than sorry.
